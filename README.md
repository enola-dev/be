# Bee 🐝

An 🐣 _incubator_ for `be`.

To be, or not to be… busy Bee!

Bee 🐝 is a Task/Action/Workflow engine & tool (CLI), which can be a build tool, or an agentic AI engine - and more...

This is a part of and may eventually get integrated into [enola](https://github.com/enola-dev/enola) (or not; TBD).

To contribute, [install Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install/) and run:

* `nix develop` to enter a dev shell to start an IDE, and run `./test.sh` to build & test
* `nix flake check` to run the tests inside an isolated Nix sandbox
* `nix fmt` to format the `flake.nix`
